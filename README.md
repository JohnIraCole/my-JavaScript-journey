# ðŸ¤“ my-JavaScript-journey

### ðŸ“… May 22, 2025
* This day marks as one of my stepping stones to becoming a Programmer! As I would be learning a new Programming Langauge that is necessary in almost any field in tech, JavaScript! 
* This would also serve as my journal as I try to learn this language. 

### 1 week of studying
- I've been studying for a week now and so far I learned some of the basics for JavaScript, but with little mastery.
- While studying I made simple projects inside each file such as Simple Calculator, Coin-Toss, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and a Cart.
- Did a quick review on HTML && CSS (I'll try to master these 2 along the way aswell).
- This week I learned about Numbers and Math, Strings, Variables, Booleans and If-Statements, Functions, and most recently - objects.
- It's been on's and off's during this week due to very little motivation, I hope in the future I can lock in like fr.

### 2 weeks of studying
- This week I've been pretty inconsistent, due to poor time management.
- I only learned DOM during this week and with very poor mastery of it. Not fully understanding its structure made me slow doing its exercise.
- The good side is that, I decorated some of my projects (Calculator and Rock-Paper-Scissors Project) and practiced a bit of CSS aswell, such as adding, removing, and checking a class.
- Overall, a very bad week for me.
- I hope I can do better next week.
