* This day marks as one of my stepping stones to becoming a Programmer! As I would be learning a new Programming Langauge that is necessary in almost any field in tech, JavaScript! 
* This would also serve as my journal as I try to learn this language.

* Today I learned how variables work on JavaScript and I also did some review on HTML and CSS.
* I also learned how to apply JavaScript to Webpages, but only the simple parts for now.
* I faced a problem that I couldn't solve ðŸ˜¢, I'll try and solve it tomorrow tho.
